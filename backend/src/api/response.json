Dietary protein is not the only source of amino acids; proteins from muscles and other tissues continually release amino acids into the bloodstream and absorb them back. This constant exchange ensures amino acids are always available in the blood for conversion to glucose (gluconeogenesis) by the liver or for protein synthesis in muscles and vital organs.\\n\\nSome diabetics still produce enough insulin to prevent excessive gluconeogenesis. However, when insulin production drops below a critical level, the liver, kidneys, and intestines may produce glucose inappropriately, raising blood sugar levels even during fasting. \\n\\nControlling this process through diet alone is often insufficient, especially in type 1 diabetics or type 2 diabetics with significant insulin deficiency and resistance. For type 2 diabetics, weight loss and vigorous exercise can improve insulin sensitivity in the liver and muscles. Ultimately, the most effective treatments typically involve medication, such as certain oral agents or insulin therapy.\",\n            \"type\": \"Document\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"lc\": 1,\n          \"type\": \"constructor\",\n          \"id\": [\n            \"langchain\",\n            \"schema\",\n            \"document\",\n            \"Document\"\n          ],\n          \"kwargs\": {\n            \"id\": \"3fba2027-285e-42a6-b12c-34af9504cb42\",\n            \"metadata\": {\n              \"origin_title\": \"dr_bernstein_diabetes_solution\",\n              \"chunk_number\": 598,\n              \"origin_type\": \"pdf\"\n            },\n            \"page_content\": \"This more severe hypoglycemic state is often characterized by extreme tiredness and an inability to communicate. You may be sitting and banging your hand on a table, walking around in a daze, or failing to respond to questions. It is important that those who live or work with you recognize this as a fairly serious stage of hypoglycemia. Delaying treatment while someone fumbles to measure your blood sugar can result in wasted valuable time. \\n\\nAt this stage, you may not chew glucose tablets and might even spit them out. The recommended treatment is glucose gel administered orally. Glucose gel, a syrupy substance sold under several brand names in the United States, is effective. One product is not pure glucose (dextrose) but contains a mixture of long- and short-acting sugars, which may delay its full effect. Currently, I advise my patients to use Dex4 gel, packaged in a plastic tube with a screw cap, containing 15 grams of glucose. \\n\\nAs shown in Table 20-1, this amount can raise the blood sugar of a 140-pound person by approximately 75 mg/dL. For most adults in this situation, about one full tube is appropriate. Some decorative icing used for cake decorating contains nearly pure glucose (dextrose), which can be a cost-effective alternative\\u2014just ensure to check the contents and weight. To convert ounces to grams, multiply by 30. Confirm that glucose is the primary ingredient, as some brands are mostly sucrose, which acts more slowly.\\n\\nIt is recommended to keep two tubes of glucose gel, secured together with a rubber band, in strategic locations such as your home, workplace, or luggage when traveling with a companion. The gel should not be refrigerated, as cold temperatures can harden it. \\n\\nTo administer, insert the tip of an open tube into the corner of your mouth, between your lower gum and cheek, then slowly squeeze out a small amount. You will likely swallow this portion. Afterward, gently squeeze out a bit more gel. Within five minutes of ingesting an entire tube, you should be able to respond to questions clearly.\\n\\nOnce you have fully recovered, check and correct your blood sugar to your target level. Since the sticky gel may have been wiped off your mouth with your hands, wash your hands before checking your blood sugar with a fingerstick.\\n\\nWhile glucose gels may not be available in all countries, they can often be purchased online. Most pharmacies and medical suppliers in industrialized nations sell flavored glucose drinks used for oral glucose tolerance tests. These are typically bottled in 10-ounce (296 ml) screw-top containers with 100 grams of glucose. A 2-ounce (60 ml) dose provides about 20 grams of glucose, sufficient to raise the blood sugar of a 140-pound person by approximately 100 mg/dL. Small doses can be administered with a plastic squeeze bottle. \\n\\nCaution is essential when giving liquid glucose, as there is a risk of inhaling it and choking. Using a gel is safer in this regard; administer only about 1/4 teaspoon per swallow to minimize choking risk.\",\n            \"type\": \"Document\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"lc\": 1,\n          \"type\": \"constructor\",\n          \"id\": [\n            \"langchain\",\n            \"schema\",\n            \"document\",\n            \"Document\"\n          ],\n          \"kwargs\": {\n            \"id\": \"db9bcd72-5f5a-46fc-b64e-b73e0776074d\",\n            \"metadata\": {\n              \"origin_title\": \"dr_bernstein_diabetes_solution\",\n              \"chunk_number\": 109,\n              \"origin_type\": \"pdf\"\n            },\n            \"page_content\": \"If you're obese, large doses of insulin can increase obesity and insulin resistance. Therefore, a primary goal should be to bring your weight into a healthy range.\\n\\nRegarding the dawn phenomenon: as you know, I am a type 1 diabetic. I may no longer produce any insulin at all. If I decide to fast for 24 hours and eat nothing, I will need to inject 4 units of long-acting insulin in the morning to prevent gluconeogenesis for about 18 hours. Checking my blood sugar every few hours shows it remains constant, confirming that the insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis.\\n\\nHowever, 18 hours after the initial injection, while still fasting, injecting another 4 units of insulin\\u2014based on common sense\\u2014should suppress gluconeogenesis overnight. In reality, it does not. I must set an alarm for 4 hours later and inject another 4 units. I then go to sleep and wake 9 to 10 hours later. Upon waking, I check my blood sugar, which is now approximately 100 mg/dl higher than it was at bedtime, instead of remaining constant as during waking hours.\\n\\nRepeating this experiment a week later yields a similar overnight rise in blood sugar. Why does this happen? Although the exact mechanics of the dawn phenomenon are not fully understood, research indicates that the liver deactivates more circulating insulin during early morning hours than at other times. This occurs regardless of whether insulin is produced naturally or injected. With insufficient circulating insulin, gluconeogenesis increases, leading to higher morning blood sugar levels.\\n\\nIn individuals without diabetes, fully functional pancreatic beta cells produce more insulin to counteract this rise. Studies recording hourly blood sugar levels throughout the night have shown that most of the increase occurs about 8 to 10 hours after bedtime. However, this does not mean you should limit sleep to 7 hours to avoid the phenomenon. The timing and magnitude of blood sugar increases vary among individuals\\u2014some experience negligible changes, others profound ones.\\n\\nBecause of these individual differences, any effective blood sugar normalization plan must be tailored to each person. Although the dawn phenomenon is more apparent in type 1 diabetics, many type 2 diabetics also exhibit signs of it. The treatments discussed in this book aim to help us circumvent this blood sugar rise.\",\n            \"type\": \"Document\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"lc\": 1,\n          \"type\": \"constructor\",\n          \"id\": [\n            \"langchain\",\n            \"schema\",\n            \"document\",\n            \"Document\"\n          ],\n          \"kwargs\": {\n            \"id\": \"9da8d5c8-6383-4712-9ac8-9316d7deffe0\",\n            \"metadata\": {\n              \"origin_title\": \"dr_bernstein_diabetes_solution\",\n              \"chunk_number\": 647,\n              \"origin_type\": \"pdf\"\n            },\n            \"page_content\": \"These patterns fluctuate so that blood sugar profiles are rarely similar on two or three consecutive days. \\n\\nThe first two patterns are highly indicative of gastroparesis, while the third pattern alone typically suffices for diagnosis:\\n\\n1. Low blood sugar occurring approximately 13 hours after certain (not necessarily all) meals.\\n2. Elevated blood sugar occurring five or more hours after meals without an apparent explanation.\\n3. Significantly higher fasting blood sugars in the morning compared to bedtime, especially if dinner was finished at least five hours before sleeping.\\n\\nWhen the bedtime long-acting insulin or insulin basal adjustment (ISA) is gradually increased to lower fasting blood sugars, it is common to find that the bedtime dose is much higher than the morning dose. On some days, fasting blood sugar may remain high, while on others, it may be normal or even low. This variability reflects attempts to compensate for delayed gastric emptying: some nights, the stomach empties slowly, causing high fasting sugars; on other nights, it empties more quickly, leading to low sugars.\\n\\nTo confirm whether these patterns are caused by delayed gastric emptying, perform this simple experiment:\\n\\n- Skip dinner and its pre-meal insulin or ISA on one night.\\n- Before bed, take your usual basal (bedtime) insulin or ISA, then measure your blood sugar.\\n- Measure your fasting blood sugar upon waking.\\n\\nIf, without supper, your blood sugar has dropped or remained unchanged overnight, gastroparesis is the most probable cause of the fluctuating morning blood sugars.\",\n            \"type\": \"Document\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    ]\n  ]\n}"
